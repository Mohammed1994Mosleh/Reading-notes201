## Controll ing the Position of El ements:
CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page:
1. Normal flow
Every block-level element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down the page than the previous one.
Even if you specify the widthof the boxes and there is space for two elements to sit side-byside,they will not appear next to each other. This is the default behavior (unless you tell the browser to do something else).
2. Relative Positioning This moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top, right, bottom, or left of where it would have been placed. Thisdoes not affect the position of surrounding elements; they stay in the position they would be in
in normal flow.
3. Ab solute positioning This positions the element in relation to its containing element. It is taken out of normal flow, meaning that it does not affect the position
of any surrounding elements (as they simply ignore the space it would have taken up). Absolutely positioned elements move as users scroll up and
down the page.

#### Fl oating El ements:
The float property allows youto take an element in normal
flow and place it as far to theleft or right of the containing element as possible.

#### Clearing Floats:
The clear property allows youto say that no element (withinthe same containing element) should touch the left or righthand
sides of a box

### Screen Sizes:
Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show
different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to
work on a range of different sized screens.

Screen Resolution:
Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some
devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most
operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

### Fixed Width Layouts:
Fixed width layout
designs do not
change size as the
user increases
or decreases
the size of their
browser window.
Measurements tend
to be given in pixels.

### Liquid Layouts:
Liquid layout designs
stretch and contract
as the user increases
or decreases the
size of their browser
window. They tend to
use percentages
