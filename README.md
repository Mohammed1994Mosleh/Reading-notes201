## html and css

### How People accesss the web:
Browsers:
People access websites using
software called a web browser.
Popular examples include
Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari,
Chrome, and Opera

Web Servers:
When you ask your browser for
a web page, the request is sent
across the Internet to a special
computer known as a web
server which hosts the website.

Screen readers:
Screen readers are programs
that read out the contents of a
computer screen to a user. They
are commonly used by people
with visual impairments.

### structure of webpages :
- Understanding structure
- Learning about markup
- Tags and elements

HTM L Us es El ements

Structure of Pages like photo:

### Attributes:
Attributes provide additional information
about the contents of an element. They appear
on the opening tag of the element and are
made up of two parts: a name and a value,
separated by an equals sign.

## The Evolution of HT ML:
Since the web was first created, there have
been several different versions of HTML.

Each new version was designed
to be an improvement on the
last (with new elements and
attributes added and older code
removed).

### DOCTYPES:
Because there have been
several versions of HTML, each
web page should begin with a
DOCTYPE declaration to tell a
browser which version of HTML
the page is using (although
browsers usually display the
page even if it is not included).
We will therefore be including
one in each example for the rest
of the book.
HTML5 :<!DOCTYPE html>
HTML4:<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC
"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
Transitional XHTML 1.0:<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC
"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/
xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
Strict XHTML 1.0:<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC
"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/
xhtml1-strict.dtd">
XML Declaration:<?xml version="1.0" ?>

### Class Attribute:also carry a class attribute.
Sometimes, rather than uniquely
identifying one element within
a document, you will want a
way to identify several elements
as being different from the
other elements on the page.
### block elements vs inline elements :
Some elements will always
appear to start on a new line in
the browser window. These are
known as block level elements.

Some elements will always
appear to continue on the
same line as their neighbouring
elements. These are known as
inline elements.

note:div element, The <div> element allows you to
group a set of elements together
in one block-level box.

## java script:
 is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[9] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

 ### Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in
the browser is very powerful. The examples below rely on the ability to:
- Access the content of the page
- Modify the content of the page
- Program rules or instructions the browser can follow
- React to events triggered by the user or browser
