## links :Links are found in nearly all web pages. Links allow users to click their way from page to page.

### we can use links to:
1. Linking to Other Sites
ex. <a href="http://www.empireonline.com">
2. Linking to Other Pages on the Same Site.
ex. <a href="index.html">

## Directory Structure:
On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the pages for each different section of the site into a new folder. Folders on a website are sometimes referred to as directories.

## Rela tive UR Ls:
Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files.

## Email Links: 
To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address, you use the <a> element.
ex. <a href="mailto:jon@example.org">Email Jon</a>

## Building Blocks:
Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text.
## inline element:
An inline element does not start on a new line.

## Controll ing the Position of Elements:
CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to controlthe layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolutepositioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the positionproperty in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.


### Normal Fl ow:In normal flow, each block-level
element sits on top of the nextone. Since this is the default way in which browsers treatHTML elements, you do not
need a CSS property to indicate that elements should appear in normal flow.

### position:relative:
Relative positioning moves anelement in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.
### Absolute Positioning:
When the position property
is given a value of absolute,
the box is taken out of normal
flow and no longer affects the
position of other elements on
the page. (They act like it is not
there.)
### Fixed Positioning:
Fixed positioning is a type
of absolute positioning that
requires the position property
to have a value of fixed.

## Overlapping El ements:
When you use relative, fixed, or
absolute positioning, boxes can
overlap. If boxes do overlap, the
elements that appear later in the
HTML code sit on top of those
that are earlier in the page.

## Fl oating El ements:

The float property allows you
to take an element in normal
flow and place it as far to the
left or right of the containing
element as possible.

## Clearing Floats:

The clear property allows you
to say that no element (within
the same containing element)
should touch the left or righthand
sides of a box. It can take
the following values:


## Screen Resolution:
Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some
devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most
operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens

### Page Sizes:
Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web
designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide
(since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).

## Fixed Width Layouts:
Fixed width layout
designs do not
change size as the
user increases
or decreases
the size of their
browser window.
Measurements tend
to be given in pixels.

## Liquid layout designs
stretch and contract
as the user increases
or decreases the
size of their browser
window. They tend to
use percentages.

## Multiple Style Sheets:
Some web page authors split
up their CSS style rules into
separate style sheets. For
example, they might use one
style sheet to control the layout
and another to control fonts,
colors and so on.


## WHAT IS A FUNCTION?:
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).
