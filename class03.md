## lists:
HTML lists allow web developers to group a set of related items in lists.
### Type of lists:
1. Unordered HTML List:
  An unordered list starts with the <ul> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.

The list items will be marked with bullets

2. Ordered HTML List:
An ordered list starts with the <ol> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.

The list items will be marked with numbers
3. HTML Description Lists:
A description list is a list of terms, with a description of each term.

4. Nested list:
A nested list or a sublist is a list within a list. The trick to marking nested lists up correctly in HTML is to recognize that the sublist is actually a child of a list item and not of a list.

## Boxes 

#### box dimension:
The CSS box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.

By default, the width and height of an element is calculated like this:

width + padding + border = actual width of an element
height + padding + border = actual height of an element

box-sizing: border-box:The box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.


### Overflowing Content:
The CSS overflow property controls what happens to content that is too big to fit into an area.

#### The overflow property has the following values:
- visible - Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box
- hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible
- scroll - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content 
- auto - Similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary

### border: the CSS border properties allow you to specify the style, width, and color of an element's border.

### padding:Padding is used to create space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.

### Margin:Margins are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.

you to turn an inline element
into a block-level element or vice
versa, and can also be used to
hide an element from the page.

### visibility:The visibility property allows
you to hide boxes from users
but It leaves a space where the
element would have been.
